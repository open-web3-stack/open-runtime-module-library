# Vesting Module

## Overview

Vesting module provides a means of scheduled balance lock on an account. It uses the *graded vesting* way, which unlocks a specific amount of balance every period of time, until all balance unlocked.

### Vesting Schedule

The schedule of a vesting is described by data structure `VestingSchedule`: from the block number of `start`, for every `period` amount of blocks, `per_period` amount of balance would unlocked, until number of periods `period_count` reached. Note in vesting schedules, *time* is measured by block number. All `VestingSchedule`s under an account could be queried in chain state.

### Using locked tokens for governance

Default implementation of tokens locks allow same balance be locked under several locks at a time.
