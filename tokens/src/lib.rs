//! # Tokens Module
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The tokens module provides fungible multi-currency functionality that
//! implements `MultiCurrency` trait.
//!
//! The tokens module provides functions for:
//!
//! - Querying and setting the balance of a given account.
//! - Getting and managing total issuance.
//! - Balance transfer between accounts.
//! - Depositing and withdrawing balance.
//! - Slashing an account balance.
//!
//! ### Implementations
//!
//! The tokens module provides implementations for following traits.
//!
//! - `MultiCurrency` - Abstraction over a fungible multi-currency system.
//! - `MultiCurrencyExtended` - Extended `MultiCurrency` with additional helper
//!   types and methods, like updating balance
//! by a given signed integer amount.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! - `transfer` - Transfer some balance to another account.
//! - `transfer_all` - Transfer all balance to another account.
//!
//! ### Genesis Config
//!
//! The tokens module depends on the `GenesisConfig`. Endowed accounts could be
//! configured in genesis configs.
