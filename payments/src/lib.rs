//!This pallet allows users to create secure reversible payments that keep
//! funds locked in a merchant's account until the off-chain goods are confirmed
//! to be received. Each payment gets assigned its own *judge* that can help
//! resolve any disputes between the two parties.

//! ## Terminology
//!
//! - Created: A payment has been created and the amount arrived to its
//!   destination but it's locked.
//! - NeedsReview: The payment has bee disputed and is awaiting settlement by a
//!   judge.
//! - IncentivePercentage: A small share of the payment amount is held in escrow
//!   until a payment is completed/cancelled. The Incentive Percentage
//!   represents this value.
//! - Resolver Account: A resolver account is assigned to every payment created,
//!   this account has the privilege to cancel/release a payment that has been
//!   disputed.
//! - Remark: The pallet allows to create payments by optionally providing some
//!   extra(limited) amount of bytes, this is reffered to as Remark. This can be
//!   used by a marketplace to seperate/tag payments.
//! - CancelBufferBlockLength: This is the time window where the recipient can
//!   dispute a cancellation request from the payment creator.

//! Extrinsics
//!
//! - `pay` - Create an payment for the given currencyid/amount
//! - `pay_with_remark` - Create a payment with a remark, can be used to tag
//!   payments
//! - `release` - Release the payment amount to recipent
//! - `cancel` - Allows the recipient to cancel the payment and release the
//!   payment amount to creator
//! - `resolve_release_payment` - Allows assigned judge to release a payment
//! - `resolve_cancel_payment` - Allows assigned judge to cancel a payment
//! - `request_refund` - Allows the creator of the payment to trigger cancel
//!   with a buffer time.
//! - `claim_refund` - Allows the creator to claim payment refund after buffer
//!   time
//! - `dispute_refund` - Allows the recipient to dispute the payment request of
//!   sender
//! - `request_payment` - Create a payment that can be completed by the sender
//!   using the `accept_and_pay` extrinsic.
//! - `accept_and_pay` - Allows the sender to fulfill a payment request created
//!   by a recipient

//! Types
//!
//! The `PaymentDetail` struct stores information about the payment/escrow. A
//! "payment" in virto network is similar to an escrow, it is used to guarantee
//! proof of funds and can be released once an agreed upon condition has reached
//! between the payment creator and recipient. The payment lifecycle is tracked
//! using the state field.

//! The `PaymentState` enum tracks the possible states that a payment can be in.
//! When a payment is 'completed' or 'cancelled' it is removed from storage and
//! hence not tracked by a state.
